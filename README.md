# Taylor Massage (WIP)

A simple, accessible small-business website I’m building to practice real-world front-end skills.  
This project is a work in progress and will evolve as I continue learning.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo
WIP — GitHub Pages coming soon

---

## ♿ Accessibility Highlights
- Semantic structure: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
- Skip link to `#main` (visible on keyboard focus)
- Descriptive link text (no “click here”)
- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for body text
- Keyboard navigation supported (Tab / Shift+Tab)
- Forms use `<label for>`; helper text via `aria-describedby`
- Images have meaningful `alt` or empty `alt` if decorative

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML5 + CSS (using my `typography.css` baseline)
- Planned additions: responsive layout, form validation, Lighthouse / aXe accessibility checks

---

## 💻 Local Setup
1. Clone this repo
